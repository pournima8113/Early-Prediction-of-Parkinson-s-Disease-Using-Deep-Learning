# Early-Prediction-of-Parkinson-s-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning

This project uses deep learning techniques to detect Parkinson's Disease from biomedical voice measurements. Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Early detection can help manage the symptoms more effectively.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify individuals as healthy or affected by Parkinson’s disease using voice data. The project involves:
* Data preprocessing
* Model building using deep learning (CNN)
* Training and evaluation
* Visualization of results

📂 Dataset
* Source: Parkinson’s Dataset
* Features: 40 MRI Images
* Target: status (1 = Parkinson’s, 0 = Healthy)

🧪 Technologies Used
* Language: Python, CSS, HTML, Javascript
* Libraries:
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, Evaluation)
  * TensorFlow / Keras (Model building)
  * Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)
  * CV2
  * SciPy
  * Flask
 * Database: phpMyAdmin (MySQL)

📊 Model Performance
* Accuracy: ~95% (can vary with tuning)
* Precision, Recall, F1-score evaluated
* Confusion matrix plotted
* Loss and accuracy graphs visualized

🔍 Future Improvements
* Use of LSTM or CNN for sequential/time-series data
* Integration of additional data like handwriting or gait
* Deploying the model as a web or mobile app
